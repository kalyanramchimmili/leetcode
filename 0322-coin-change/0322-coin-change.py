1. Learnt dp for this problem, there is still a lot to learn in dp space on how to build towards the approach. Dp is basically backtracking with memorization.
2. how this one is solved is first a dp array is intialized with amount + 1, for comaprision, it can be float('inf') as well.
3. dp[0] is 0, and considering for all coins begin with first coin, for dp[1] for 1 Rs, it would be 1 coing which is either min(dp[1], 1+dp[0]) i.e if 1 is not visited before it would be amount+1, so it woukd be 1 coin more than dp[0].
4. Same thing with dp[2] etc until dp[amount], now coin 2, it will start from currAmount >= coin that index, so say for making 4 we take 4 1Rs coins, now we have a 4rs, so it shld be 1 min(4, dp[4-4]+1) i.e 1, for coin 7 etc.
5. if sp[amount] is same as intial set value then there is no solution return -1 else return the dp value.
