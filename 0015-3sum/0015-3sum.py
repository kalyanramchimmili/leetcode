1. This was the famous 3-sum problem, it was a bit tough, specially skipping negatives.
2. we are taking one fixed pointer from 0 to n-2 len, we have left which is fixed +1 and right at last element (one fixed element and 2 pointer method).
3. sort the array before we began, if sum of all 3 pos is > 0 right -- if < 0 then left ++, else append those triplet to ans and dec right and inc left.
4. to avoid duplicates, the top loop if fixed pos > 0 and the prev fixed int is same as present one, skip it to not add those values again.
(for eg:- [-1, -1, 0, 1]. shld be -1, 0, 1 so skip if the prev value is same in cases such as this).
4.1 a second while loop to skip the duplicated for [1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0], if left is same as prev value and is less than right skip that left by inc the left.
4.2 if the smallest value it is fixed greater than 0 then no way the sum is o break and return the value.
5. return the ans.
